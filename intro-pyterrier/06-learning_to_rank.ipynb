    "LTR models are commonly used in a two-stage process (_retrieve-and-re-rank_): A lightweight retrieval model is used for _candidate selection_ given a query, and the LTR model subsequently _re-ranks_ the candidates. This is because applying the LTR model directly on the whole corpus would be too expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use good old BM25 for first-stage retrieval. In order to keep the runtime of this notebook down, we limit the number of documents to be re-ranked to `100`. We also include the metadata of the retrieved documents so we can use it to compute features later:\n"
